Test scripts. 

For development purposes only. Users can ignore these files.

`test_examples.py` tests whether the example scripts in `demos_and_examples` can run without errors.

`test_verification_*.py` tests theoretical soundness of UXsim as a traffic flow simulator, namely, whether it can output reasonable solutions of the underlying mathematical models (e.g., KW theory, DUO).

Other `test_*.py` tests other functionalities of UXsim.
